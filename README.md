It is a cloned webpage of urban company website
This file consists html, css files 
in html 
starting from the navbar , i have used bootstrap snippet, and used image source for hero section
after that i have used card snippets for carousel sections , and at last for footer i have used bootstrap snippet .
and some jpg's for making this cloned webpage more attractive and to look more closer like original webpage.
